	<h2>We are back!</h2>
	<p>We are thrilled to announce the re-launch of our company as ChainFactor, with new and exciting products that will revolutionize the way you trade and transect. After experiencing the recent volatility in the cryptocurrency market, we have changed our strategy and revamped our Artificial Intelligence trading system to maximize profits and provide more stable investment opportunities.<p>

As part of our commitment to our clients, we want everyone to migrate to our new system by downloading our app and registering with their previous credentials to regain access to their wallets. Rest assured, your funds are still safe and secured, Thanks to the power of Blockchain and Decentralized app technology. Also we have taken all necessary precautions to ensure their protection.<p>

The system will no longer be trading with bitcoin but instead with USDT, a more stable cryptocurrency that offers greater predictability and a better trading experience. Our team has been working tirelessly to develop new database plans and partner with known brands in the industry to ensure the quality of our service and the security of your investments.<p>

Migration can be a complex task, so we will be implementing a gradual process to make it as smooth and seamless as possible for everyone involved. Our team is committed to providing the necessary support and assistance to make this transition as easy as possible for you.<p>

We are excited about this new chapter in our company's history and look forward to working with you to achieve your investment goals. Thank you for your continued trust and support, and we hope to see you soon on ChainFactor.<p>

Sincerely,
The ChainFactor Team</p></p>
